Part 1
=========


* A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)


`@Test`
  `public void test1() {`
    `int[] input1 = {3,3,3,1};`
    `assertArrayEquals(new int[]{1,3,3,3}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));`
  `}`
`}`


* An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)


`@Test`
  `public void testReversed() {`
    `int[] input1 = { };`
    `assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));`
  `}`


* The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)





* The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)


  `static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {`
    `int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];`
    `for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {`
      `arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];`
    `}`
    `return arr;`
   `}`


  `static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {`
    `int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];`
    `for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {`
      `arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];`
    `}`
    `return newArray;`
